## NOVA Blueprint - SN68

ML‑driven drug discovery on Bittensor.
NOVA Blueprint powers SN68 by running competitive cycles that explore vast chemical spaces, collect candidate molecules, and iteratively build on the best‑performing approaches.

This codebase implements the SN68 validator scheduler and the sandboxed miner runner: it pulls miner snapshots from the submission API + MinIO archive, generates per‑cycle challenges, executes miners in an isolated Docker sandbox within a fixed time budget, and collects `/output/result.json`. Binding affinity is predicted by a Boltz-2 oracle, which both the sandbox and the validator score against.

### System Requirements (validators)
- Docker with docker compose plugin
- Access to a NOVA oracle endpoint (`ORACLE_URL`, `ORACLE_TOKEN`)
- Bittensor wallets on host (default: `$HOME/.bittensor/wallets`)

---


## For Validators

### Install and run
1) Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/metanova-labs/nova-blueprint.git
cd nova-blueprint
```

2) Create and fill `.env`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```
BT_WALLET_COLD=your_cold_wallet_name
BT_WALLET_HOT=your_hotkey_name
SUBTENSOR_NETWORK=finney
SNAPSHOT_S3_ENDPOINT=s3.metanova-labs.ai
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=your_minio_access_key
MINIO_SECRET_KEY=your_minio_secret_key
SUBMISSION_API_URL=https://submission-api.metanova-labs.ai
SUBMISSION_API_KEY=your_submission_read_api_key
# Optional if your wallets are not in the default location
# BT_WALLETS_DIR=$HOME/.bittensor/wallets 
```

3) Run the validator:
```bash
docker compose down && docker compose pull && docker compose up -d && docker compose logs -f
```

Notes:
- Artifacts/results are written under `./data/miner_runs` and `./data/results` by default.
- Auto‑update is handled by the bundled watchtower sidecar.

## For Miners 

Your miner repo is cloned and executed in a Docker sandbox (no network, read‑only root; use `/tmp`).
Available: `rdkit`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `scipy`, `tqdm`, `nova_miner`.

Must‑haves:
- `miner.py` at repo root is run as `python /workspace/miner.py`
- Read input from `/workspace/input.json`
- Write output to `/output/result.json` with exactly `num_molecules` reaction‑formatted molecules (`rxn:*`)

**Rules**: everything your submission runs must be present as readable source, and the molecules must be generated inside the sandbox. Precomputed results, seeded molecule lists, and compiled artifacts are ineligible. If your approach needs something the sandbox does not provide, contact the NOVA team.

Minimal example `result.json`:
```json
{
  "molecules": ["rxn:4:…", "rxn:5:…"]
}
```

**Scoring**: binding affinity comes from the oracle, reached over the unix socket at `$ORACLE_SOCKET`. One request covers every (molecule, target) pair.

```python
import os
from nova_miner.utils.oracle import Oracle, combine
from nova_miner.utils.molecules import get_heavy_atom_count

oracle = Oracle(os.environ["ORACLE_SOCKET"])
rows = oracle.score(targets=target_sequences, smiles=["CCO"])
score = combine(rows[0]["scores"][0], get_heavy_atom_count("CCO"))
```

`combine` reduces the Boltz-2 metrics to the number you are ranked by; higher is better, `-inf` where no prediction was returned. Requests are spread across the oracle's 24 shards, so twenty-four pairs cost about as much as one — batch widely. `neurons/miner/` is an example.

Miners can trade inference cost for fidelity during search by passing the full
Boltz-2 prediction configuration. Omit `boltz2` for the canonical defaults:

```python
rows = oracle.score(
    targets=target_sequences,
    smiles=candidates,
    boltz2={
        "recycling_steps": 1,
        "sampling_steps": 50,
        "diffusion_samples": 1,
        "recycling_steps_affinity": 2,
        "sampling_steps_affinity": 50,
        "diffusion_samples_affinity": 1,
        "skip_affinity_structure": False,
        "skip_affinity_confidence": False,
        "max_parallel_samples": 1,
        "token_precision": "float32",
        "batched_diffusion": True,
    },
)
```

The broker forwards every JSON-serializable entry in `boltz2` without a
parameter allowlist, so miners can use the complete prediction API and future
Boltz-2 options without a Blueprint release. The oracle validates model-specific
values and enforces compute limits. These settings apply only to miner oracle
calls. Final validator scoring deliberately omits them and always uses the
canonical oracle configuration, so all submissions remain directly comparable.

**Note - Combinatorial SQLite DB**: open the provided database in read‑only mode to avoid write errors on a read‑only filesystem. Example: `sqlite3.connect(f"file:{db_path}?mode=ro&immutable=1", uri=True)`.

Timing: You have a fixed time budget to generate the highest‑scoring set of molecules, at timeout molecules are collected to be scored against other submissions.  
Where it’s defined: `config/config.yaml` → `run.time_budget_sec` (default 3600s).  
Recommendation: keep `/output/result.json` up‑to‑date during the run so the latest results are captured when the sandbox exits.

### Miner submission SDK

Use the SDK to upload signed code submissions for the competition.

```python
from utils.submission_uploader import submit_from_local_path, submit_from_github_url

result = submit_from_local_path(
    local_path="/path/to/miner_project_dir", 
    wallet_name="my_wallet",
    hotkey_name="my_hotkey",
    submission_name="dock-sense2",  # name appears on the dashboard
)

# or
result = submit_from_github_url(
    github_url="https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>",
    wallet_name="my_wallet",
    hotkey_name="my_hotkey",
    submission_name="dock-sense2",  # name appears on the dashboard
)

print(result.status_code, result.ok, result.request_id, result.body)
```

Notes:
- Submissions must be signed by a hotkey that owns the submission (its coldkey receives emissions if you win). One active slot per hotkey per epoch; re-submitting with the same hotkey in the same epoch overwrites the previous code upload with no fee.
- Submission eligibility and instructions depend on the live submission mode; check `GET /quote?hotkey=<ss58>` and https://submission-api.metanova-labs.ai/docs
